# Country Explorer

Country Explorer is a simple web app that allows you to explore information about each country. It displays basic information such as the country name, flag, capital city, population, and area. This information is displayed in a modern "card" style, making it easy to read and navigate.

## Usage

There are two main routes in the app:

- `/`: This is the landing page of the app, which displays information about all the countries. You can click on any of the countries to view more information about that country.
- `/countries/:code`: This route displays more detailed information about a specific country. You can replace `:code` with the two-letter country code (e.g. `/countries/US` for the United States).

## Technologies Used

The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/) to fetch country data.

## Installation

To run the app locally, you'll need to have Node.js installed. Once you've installed Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/country-explorer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd country-explorer`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
